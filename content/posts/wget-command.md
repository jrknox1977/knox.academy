If the installation was successful, you should see the version number of wget along with other information displayed on the screen.

### B. Basic usage of wget

Once wget is installed, you can start using it to download files from the internet. Understanding the syntax and command structure of wget is crucial for using it effectively.

1. Syntax and command structure

   The basic syntax of the wget command is as follows:

   ```
   wget [options] [URL]
   ```

   Here, `[options]` refers to the various command-line options and flags that you can use to customize the downloading behavior of wget. `[URL]` represents the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) of the file or web page you want to download.

2. Understanding options and flags

   Wget offers a wide range of options and flags that allow you to control various aspects of the downloading process. Some commonly used options include:

   - `-O`: Specifies the output file name for the downloaded content.
   - `-P`: Specifies the directory where the downloaded file should be saved.
   - `-r`: Enables recursive downloading, allowing you to download entire websites or directories.
   - `-np`: Prevents wget from ascending to the parent directory while downloading recursively.
   - `-nH`: Disables the generation of host directories when downloading recursively.
   - `-c`: Resumes interrupted downloads.
   
   These are just a few examples of the options and flags available. To explore the full range of options and their usage, you can refer to the wget documentation or use the `--help` command to display the built-in help information.

With wget installed and a basic understanding of its usage, you are now ready to start downloading files and exploring the various features and capabilities it offers. In the next section, we will delve deeper into downloading files with wget.
III. Downloading Files with wget

A. Downloading a single file

1. Specifying the URL

To download a single file using wget, you need to specify the URL of the file you want to download. This can be done by simply providing the URL as an argument to the wget command. For example:

```markdown
$ wget https://example.com/file.txt
```

This will download the file.txt from the specified URL and save it in the current working directory.

2. Saving the file with desired name/location

By default, wget saves the downloaded file with its original name in the current working directory. However, you can specify a different name or location for the downloaded file using the `-O` or `--output-document` option. For example:

```markdown
$ wget -O myFile.txt https://example.com/file.txt
```

This command will download the file.txt from the specified URL and save it as myFile.txt in the current working directory.

You can also provide an absolute or relative path to save the file in a specific location. For example:

```markdown
$ wget -O /path/to/save/myFile.txt https://example.com/file.txt
```

This command will download the file.txt from the specified URL and save it as myFile.txt in the specified path.

B. Downloading multiple files

1. Using wildcards and patterns

wget supports downloading multiple files using wildcards and patterns. You can use wildcards such as `*` to match multiple files with similar names or patterns. For example:

```markdown
$ wget https://example.com/files/*.txt
```

This command will download all the .txt files from the specified URL's files directory.

2. Recursive downloading

In addition to using wildcards, wget also supports recursive downloading, which allows you to download files and directories recursively from a given URL. You can enable recursive downloading using the `-r` or `--recursive` option. For example:

```markdown
$ wget -r https://example.com/files/
```

This command will download all files and directories from the specified URL's files directory, including subdirectories.

C. Resuming interrupted downloads

1. Handling connection failures and interruptions

wget automatically handles connection failures and interruptions during the download process. If the connection is lost or interrupted, wget will attempt to reconnect and resume the download from where it left off. It will retry multiple times, depending on the configuration.

2. Utilizing the "--continue" option

You can explicitly instruct wget to continue interrupted downloads by using the `--continue` option. For example:

```markdown
$ wget --continue https://example.com/file.txt
```

This command will resume the download of file.txt from the specified URL if it was interrupted or partially downloaded before.

By default, wget will check the file size and only resume the download if the local file is smaller than the remote file. If you want to force wget to always resume, even if the local file is larger, you can use the `-c` or `--continue` option instead.
IV. Advanced Features and Options
