2. **Permission denied (publickey)**: This error indicates a problem with SSH key-based authentication. Verify that the public key is correctly configured on the server and that the corresponding private key is available on the client. Additionally, check the file permissions of the SSH key files (typically `~/.ssh/id_rsa` and `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`) to ensure they are secure.

3. **Host key verification failed**: This error occurs when the SSH client detects a mismatch between the host key stored locally and the one presented by the server. It could indicate a potential security threat, such as a man-in-the-middle attack. To resolve this, remove the conflicting host key from the client's `known_hosts` file and try connecting again.

### B. Diagnosing connection problems

When encountering SSH connection problems, it is essential to diagnose the root cause. Here are some techniques to help diagnose connection issues:

1. **Check network connectivity**: Ensure that both the client and server have a stable network connection. Test connectivity using tools like `ping` or `traceroute` to identify any network-related issues.

2. **Verify SSH server status**: Confirm that the SSH server is running on the remote host. Check the server's logs for any error messages or indications of issues.

3. **Review SSH client configuration**: Double-check the client's SSH configuration file (`~/.ssh/config`) for any misconfigurations or conflicting settings that may affect the connection.

### C. Debugging SSH commands and configuration

Debugging SSH commands and configuration can provide valuable insights into the underlying issues. Use the following techniques to enable SSH debugging:

1. **Increase verbosity**: Add the `-v` (or `-vv` for higher verbosity) option to the SSH command to display detailed debugging information. This can help identify where the problem lies.

2. **Inspect SSH logs**: Examine the SSH logs on both the client and server sides. The client-side logs are typically located at `~/.ssh/` directory, while the server-side logs can be found in system log files such as `/var/log/auth.log`.

By applying these troubleshooting techniques, you can effectively address common SSH errors, diagnose connection problems, and debug SSH commands and configurations.
