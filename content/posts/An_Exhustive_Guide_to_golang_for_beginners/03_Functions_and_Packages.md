III. Functions and Packages
# III. Functions and Packages

## A. Defining and calling functions

In Go, functions are an essential part of the language. They allow you to encapsulate a set of instructions and reuse them whenever needed. This section will cover the basics of defining and calling functions in Go.

### 1. Function declaration
   a. Syntax and structure of function declaration

   To define a function in Go, you need to use the `func` keyword followed by the function name and a set of parentheses for the parameters. The function body is enclosed in curly braces. Here's an example of a simple function declaration:

   ```go
   func sayHello() {
       fmt.Println("Hello, world!")
   }
   ```

   b. Naming conventions for functions

   Go follows the camel case naming convention for functions. It is recommended to use descriptive names that convey the purpose of the function. For example:

   ```go
   func calculateCircleArea(radius float64) float64 {
       return math.Pi * radius * radius
   }
   ```

   c. Understanding the function signature

   The function signature consists of the function name and the list of parameter types. It helps define the uniqueness of the function within a package. For example:

   ```go
   func addNumbers(a int, b int) int {
       return a + b
   }
   ```

   d. Specifying the return type of a function

   In Go, you explicitly specify the return type of a function. This helps in maintaining clarity and readability. Here's an example:

   ```go
   func isEven(num int) bool {
       if num%2 == 0 {
           return true
       }
       return false
   }
   ```

   e. Using multiple return values

   Go allows functions to return multiple values. This feature is useful in scenarios where you need to return more than one result. Here's an example:

   ```go
   func divide(a, b int) (int, error) {
       if b == 0 {
           return 0, errors.New("division by zero")
       }
       return a / b, nil
   }
   ```

### 2. Function arguments and return values
   a. Passing arguments to functions

   In Go, you pass arguments to functions by value. This means that a copy of the argument is made and passed to the function. Any modifications made to the argument within the function do not affect the original value. Here's an example:

   ```go
   func double(num int) {
       num *= 2
   }

   func main() {
       num := 5
       double(num)
       fmt.Println(num) // Output: 5
   }
   ```

   b. Understanding pass by value and pass by reference

   In Go, all function arguments are passed by value. However, if you want to modify the original value within a function, you can use pointers. By passing the address of the variable as an argument, you can achieve pass by reference behavior. Here's an example:

   ```go
   func doubleByReference(num *int) {
       *num *= 2
   }

   func main() {
       num := 5
       doubleByReference(&num)
       fmt.Println(num) // Output: 10
   }
   ```

   c. Returning values from functions

   Functions can return values using the `return` statement. You can specify the return type in the function signature and use the `return` keyword followed by the value(s) to be returned. Here's an example:

   ```go
   func add(a, b int) int {
       return a + b
   }

   func main() {
       result := add(3, 5)
       fmt.Println(result) // Output: 8
   }
   ```

   d. Handling multiple return values

   If a function returns multiple values, you can assign them to multiple variables or use the blank identifier `_` to discard unwanted values. Here's an example:

   ```go
   func divide(a, b int) (int, int) {
       quotient := a / b
       remainder := a % b
       return quotient, remainder
   }

   func main() {
       q, r := divide(10, 3)
       fmt.Println(q, r) // Output: 3 1
   }
   ```

This concludes the section on defining and calling functions in Go. Next, we will explore the concept of packages and how they help in organizing code.
# B. Working with built-in functions

## 1. Overview of built-in functions

Go programming language provides a set of built-in functions that are readily available for use without the need for any additional packages or imports. These functions perform a wide range of tasks such as mathematical calculations, string manipulations, input/output operations, and error handling.

## 2. Commonly used built-in functions

### a. Math functions

Go includes a variety of built-in math functions that allow you to perform mathematical operations. Some commonly used math functions are:

- `abs(x)` - Returns the absolute value of x.
- `sqrt(x)` - Returns the square root of x.
- `pow(x, y)` - Returns x raised to the power of y.
- `max(x, y)` - Returns the larger of the two values, x and y.

Here's an example that demonstrates the usage of these math functions:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)

func main() {
	x := -10
	y := 25

	fmt.Println(math.Abs(float64(x)))
	fmt.Println(math.Sqrt(float64(y)))
	fmt.Println(math.Pow(float64(x), float64(y)))
	fmt.Println(math.Max(float64(x), float64(y)))
}
```

### b. String manipulation functions

Go provides built-in functions to manipulate strings efficiently. Some commonly used string manipulation functions are:

- `len(s)` - Returns the length of the string s.
- `toUpperCase(s)` - Converts the string s to uppercase.
- `toLowerCase(s)` - Converts the string s to lowercase.
- `contains(s, substr)` - Checks if the string s contains the substring substr.

Here's an example that demonstrates the usage of these string manipulation functions:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"strings"
)

func main() {
	s := "Hello, World!"

	fmt.Println(len(s))
	fmt.Println(strings.ToUpper(s))
	fmt.Println(strings.ToLower(s))
	fmt.Println(strings.Contains(s, "World"))
}
```

### c. Input and output functions

Go provides built-in functions to handle input and output operations. Some commonly used input/output functions are:

- `fmt.Printf(format, args...)` - Prints formatted output to the standard output.
- `fmt.Scanf(format, args...)` - Reads formatted input from the standard input.
- `fmt.Println(args...)` - Prints the arguments to the standard output followed by a newline.

Here's an example that demonstrates the usage of these input/output functions:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	name := "John"
	age := 30

	fmt.Printf("Name: %s, Age: %d\n", name, age)

	var input string
	fmt.Print("Enter your name: ")
	fmt.Scanf("%s", &input)
	fmt.Println("Hello,", input)
}
```

### d. Error handling functions

Go provides built-in functions to handle errors effectively. Some commonly used error handling functions are:

- `panic(v)` - Terminates the program with a runtime error and displays the value v.
- `recover()` - Recovers from a panic and returns the value that was passed to the call to panic.

Here's an example that demonstrates the usage of these error handling functions:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	defer func() {
		if err := recover(); err != nil {
			fmt.Println("Recovered from panic:", err)
		}
	}()

	panic("Something went wrong!")
}
```

These are just a few examples of the built-in functions available in Go. Familiarizing yourself with these functions and their usage will greatly enhance your productivity as a Go programmer.
# C. Creating and using packages

Packages are an essential part of Go programming as they allow us to organize our code into reusable and maintainable units. In this section, we will explore how to import and use packages, as well as how to create and structure our own packages.

## 1. Importing packages

Importing packages enables us to use the functionality provided by external code. There are three types of packages that we can import: standard library packages, third-party packages, and local packages.

### a. Importing standard library packages

Go provides a rich set of standard library packages that cover a wide range of functionalities. We can import these packages simply by using the import statement followed by the package name.

```go
import "fmt"
import "time"
```

Once imported, we can access the functions, variables, and types provided by the standard library packages.

```go
fmt.Println("Hello, world!")
time.Sleep(5 * time.Second)
```

### b. Importing third-party packages

In addition to the standard library, Go has a vast ecosystem of third-party packages that we can leverage in our projects. To import a third-party package, we need to use the import statement followed by the package name.

```go
import "github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
```

After importing the package, we can use its functionalities just like any other package.

```go
router := gin.Default()
router.GET("/", func(c *gin.Context) {
    c.JSON(200, gin.H{"message": "Hello, world!"})
})
router.Run(":8080")
```

### c. Importing local packages

Go allows us to create and import our own packages within our project. To import a local package, we need to provide the relative path to the package directory.

```go
import "./myutils"
```

Once imported, we can access the exported functions, variables, and types defined within the package.

```go
myutils.DoSomething()
```

## 2. Creating and organizing packages

To create a new package, we need to follow a specific structure and adhere to certain conventions.

### a. Creating a new package

To create a new package, we create a directory with the desired package name and place our Go source files (*.go) inside it. Each source file within the package directory should start with the package declaration, specifying the package name.

```go
package mypackage

// Source code for the package goes here
```

### b. Structuring the package directory

It is recommended to organize the package directory using a hierarchical structure that reflects the logical components of our code. For example, a package named "mypackage" may have subdirectories like "mypackage/utils" and "mypackage/models" to group related code.

```
mypackage/
    utils/
        helper.go
    models/
        user.go
    main.go
```

### c. Exporting and importing functions within a package

Within a package, functions, variables, and types can be exported or unexported. Exported identifiers start with an uppercase letter, making them accessible from other packages. Unexported identifiers start with a lowercase letter and can only be accessed within the package.

```go
package mypackage

func ExportedFunction() {
    // Function implementation
}

func unexportedFunction() {
    // Function implementation
}
```

To use exported functions, variables, or types from another package, we need to import the package and then access the exported identifiers using the package name.

```go
import "mypackage"

mypackage.ExportedFunction()
```

By following these guidelines, we can create well-organized and modular packages in Go, making our code more reusable and easier to maintain.
# III. Functions and Packages

## D. Documenting code using comments and GoDoc

Code documentation plays a crucial role in maintaining and understanding the codebase. It helps other developers, including yourself in the future, to quickly grasp the purpose and usage of various functions and packages. In Go, code documentation is primarily done using comments and the GoDoc tool.

### 1. Importance of code documentation

Documenting code effectively can save hours of development time and reduce the learning curve for new developers joining a project. It provides insights into the functionality, usage, and expected behavior of the code. Good documentation also helps in identifying and resolving issues quickly, as it provides context and explanations for the code logic.

### 2. Writing meaningful comments

#### a. Commenting on function declarations

When documenting functions, it is essential to describe the purpose of the function, the parameters it accepts, and the values it returns. This information helps users understand how to use the function correctly. Here's an example illustrating the use of comments in function declarations:

```go
// addNumbers adds two integers and returns their sum.
func addNumbers(a, b int) int {
    return a + b
}
```

#### b. Commenting on function arguments and return values

Comments can be used to provide additional information about function arguments and return values. This information can include data types, expected ranges, or any constraints on the values. Consider the following example:

```go
// divideNumbers divides two integers and returns the quotient and remainder.
// It returns an error if the divisor is zero.
func divideNumbers(dividend, divisor int) (quotient, remainder int, err error) {
    if divisor == 0 {
        return 0, 0, errors.New("division by zero")
    }
    return dividend / divisor, dividend % divisor, nil
}
```

#### c. Commenting on package functions and variables

When documenting package-level functions and variables, it is crucial to provide an overview of their purpose and usage. This helps users understand the functionality offered by the package. Here's an example illustrating comments for a package-level function:

```go
// Package mathutil provides utility functions for mathematical operations.
package mathutil

// AddNumbers adds two integers and returns their sum.
func AddNumbers(a, b int) int {
    return a + b
}
```

### 3. Generating documentation with GoDoc

GoDoc is a built-in tool that automatically generates documentation from comments in Go source code. It provides a web-based interface to browse and search the documentation. To generate documentation using GoDoc, run the following command in the terminal:

```shell
$ godoc -http=:8080
```

This command starts a local web server on port 8080, allowing you to access the generated documentation in a web browser. By default, GoDoc looks for package documentation in the `package` comment at the beginning of each source file.

In conclusion, documenting code using comments and GoDoc is essential for maintaining a well-documented and easily understandable codebase. It helps improve collaboration, code reuse, and aids in both the development and maintenance phases of a project.
