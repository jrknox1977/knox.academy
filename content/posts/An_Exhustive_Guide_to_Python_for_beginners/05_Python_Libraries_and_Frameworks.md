   plt.text(4, 5, 'Important Point', style='italic', fontsize=12)
   
   plt.legend()
   plt.show()
   ```

   Output:
   ![Customized Plot](customized_plot.png)
## B. Data analysis and manipulation with Pandas

Pandas is a powerful library in Python that provides data structures and functions for efficient data analysis and manipulation. In this section, we will explore the various capabilities of Pandas for data analysis and manipulation.

### 1. Loading and inspecting data

a. Reading data from different file formats (CSV, Excel, etc.)

Pandas provides convenient functions to read data from various file formats such as CSV, Excel, and more. For example, to read a CSV file, you can use the `read_csv()` function:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Read a CSV file
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
```

b. Data exploration and summary statistics

Once the data is loaded, Pandas allows you to explore and summarize the data easily. You can use functions like `head()` to view the first few rows of the data, `describe()` to get summary statistics, and `info()` to get information about the data columns.

```python
# View the first few rows of the data
print(data.head())

# Get summary statistics of the data
print(data.describe())

# Get information about the data columns
print(data.info())
```

c. Handling missing data

Dealing with missing data is a common task in data analysis. Pandas provides several functions to handle missing data, such as `dropna()` to remove rows or columns with missing values, and `fillna()` to fill missing values with a specific value or strategy.

```python
# Remove rows with missing values
data = data.dropna()

# Fill missing values with a specific value
data = data.fillna(0)
```

### 2. Data cleaning and preprocessing

a. Removing duplicates

Duplicates in the data can lead to incorrect analysis. Pandas provides the `drop_duplicates()` function to remove duplicate rows from the data.

```python
# Remove duplicate rows
data = data.drop_duplicates()
```

b. Handling outliers

Outliers are extreme values that can skew the analysis. Pandas offers various techniques to handle outliers, such as filtering based on statistical measures like z-score or interquartile range.

```python
# Filter data based on z-score
data = data[(data['column'] - data['column'].mean()) / data['column'].std() < 3]
```

c. Data normalization and scaling

Data normalization and scaling are important preprocessing steps to bring the data to a common scale. Pandas provides functions like `MinMaxScaler` or `StandardScaler` from the `sklearn.preprocessing` module to normalize or scale the data.

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler

# Normalize data
scaler = MinMaxScaler()
data_normalized = scaler.fit_transform(data)
```

### 3. Data manipulation and transformation

a. Filtering and selecting data

Pandas allows you to filter and select data based on specific conditions. You can use boolean indexing or functions like `loc[]` or `iloc[]` to filter and select data.

```python
# Filter data based on a condition
filtered_data = data[data['column'] > 10]

# Select specific columns
selected_columns = data[['column1', 'column2']]

# Select data based on index or labels
selected_data = data.loc[10:20, 'column1':'column3']
```

b. Sorting and grouping data

Pandas provides functions to sort data based on one or more columns using `sort_values()`. Additionally, you can group data based on a column or multiple columns using `groupby()`.

```python
# Sort data based on a column
sorted_data = data.sort_values('column')

# Group data based on a column
grouped_data = data.groupby('column')
```

c. Applying functions to data

Pandas allows you to apply custom functions to data using `apply()`. This enables you to perform complex calculations or transformations on the data.

```python
# Apply a function to a column
data['new_column'] = data['column'].apply(custom_function)

# Apply a function to each row
data['new_column'] = data.apply(custom_function, axis=1)
```

With these capabilities, Pandas empowers beginners to perform data analysis and manipulation efficiently.
# C. Scientific computing with NumPy

NumPy is a powerful library in Python that provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently. This section will cover the key features and functionalities of NumPy.

## 1. Arrays and indexing

### a. Creating arrays and accessing elements

Arrays are the fundamental data structure in NumPy, and they can be created using various methods. One common way is to convert a Python list to an array using the `numpy.array()` function. For example:

```python
import numpy as np

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
my_array = np.array(my_list)
print(my_array)
```

Output:
```
[1 2 3 4 5]
```

Once we have an array, we can access its elements using indexing. Indexing in NumPy starts from 0, similar to regular Python lists. For example:

```python
import numpy as np

my_array = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(my_array[0])  # Accessing the first element
print(my_array[2])  # Accessing the third element
```

Output:
```
1
3
```

### b. Slicing and subsetting arrays

NumPy allows us to extract a portion of an array using slicing. Slicing is done using the colon (`:`) operator. For example:

```python
import numpy as np

my_array = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(my_array[1:4])  # Slicing from index 1 to 3 (exclusive)
```

Output:
```
[2 3 4]
```

We can also subset arrays using Boolean indexing, where we provide a Boolean condition to filter out specific elements. For example:

```python
import numpy as np

my_array = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
condition = my_array > 3  # Boolean condition
print(my_array[condition])  # Subset array based on the condition
```

Output:
```
[4 5]
```

### c. Boolean indexing and filtering

In addition to Boolean indexing for subsetting arrays, NumPy provides various functions to filter arrays based on specific conditions. One such function is `numpy.where()`, which returns the indices of the elements that satisfy a given condition. For example:

```python
import numpy as np

my_array = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
condition = my_array > 2  # Boolean condition
indices = np.where(condition)  # Get indices of elements satisfying the condition
print(indices)
```

Output:
```
(array([2, 3, 4]),)
```

## 2. Mathematical operations and functions

### a. Arithmetic operations with arrays

NumPy allows us to perform arithmetic operations on arrays efficiently. These operations are applied element-wise, meaning each element of the array is operated individually. For example:

```python
import numpy as np

array1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
array2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])
result = array1 + array2  # Element-wise addition
print(result)
```

Output:
```
[5 7 9]
```

### b. Linear algebra operations

NumPy provides extensive support for linear algebra operations. We can perform matrix multiplication, calculate determinants, solve linear equations, and much more using the `numpy.linalg` module. For example:

```python
import numpy as np

matrix1 = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
matrix2 = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])
result = np.dot(matrix1, matrix2)  # Matrix multiplication
print(result)
```

Output:
```
[[19 22]
 [43 50]]
```

### c. Statistical functions and random number generation

NumPy offers a wide range of statistical functions to analyze and manipulate data. These functions can calculate mean, standard deviation, variance, and more. Additionally, NumPy provides functions for generating random numbers from various distributions. For example:

```python
import numpy as np

data = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
mean = np.mean(data)  # Calculate mean
std_dev = np.std(data)  # Calculate standard deviation
random_numbers = np.random.rand(5)  # Generate 5 random numbers from a uniform distribution
print(mean, std_dev, random_numbers)
```

Output:
```
3.0 1.4142135623730951 [0.81320975 0.90355661 0.01363638 0.77567808 0.9157277 ]
```

## 3. Array broadcasting and reshaping

### a. Broadcasting rules and examples

Array broadcasting is a powerful feature of NumPy that allows us to perform arithmetic operations between arrays of different shapes. In broadcasting, smaller arrays are "broadcasted" to match the shape of larger arrays, enabling element-wise operations. For example:

```python
import numpy as np

array1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
array2 = np.array([[4], [5], [6]])
result = array1 + array2  # Broadcasting and addition
print(result)
```

Output:
```
[[5 6 7]
 [6 7 8]
 [7 8 9]]
```

### b. Reshaping arrays and changing dimensions

NumPy provides functions to reshape arrays and change their dimensions. These functions include `numpy.reshape()`, `numpy.flatten()`, and `numpy.transpose()`, among others. For example:

```python
import numpy as np

my_array = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
reshaped_array = np.reshape(my_array, (3, 2))  # Reshape array to (3, 2)
flattened_array = my_array.flatten()  # Flatten array
transposed_array = np.transpose(my_array)  # Transpose array
print(reshaped_array)
print(flattened_array)
print(transposed_array)
```

Output:
```
[[1 2]
 [3 4]
 [5 6]]

[1 2 3 4 5 6]

[[1 4]
 [2 5]
 [3 6]]
```

In this section, we covered the basics of scientific computing with NumPy. We explored arrays and indexing, mathematical operations and functions, and array broadcasting and reshaping. NumPy provides a solid foundation for scientific computing in Python, and it is widely used in various fields such as data analysis, machine learning, and simulations.

### 3. Getting started with Flask

   a. Installing Flask and setting up a basic application
   
      To get started with Flask, you need to install it and set up a basic application. Here are the steps:
      
      1. Install Flask using pip:
      
         ```
         $ pip install flask
         ```
         
      2. Create a new Flask application:
      
         ```python
         # app.py
         from flask import Flask

         app = Flask(__name__)

         @app.route('/')
         def hello():
             return 'Hello, world!'

         if __name__ == '__main__':
             app.run()
         ```
         
   b. Handling routes and requests
   
      Once you have set up a Flask application, you can start handling routes and requests. Here are the steps:
      
      1. Define routes and corresponding view functions in your application:
      
         ```python
         # app.py
         from flask import Flask

         app = Flask(__name__)

         @app.route('/')
         def hello():
             return 'Hello, world!'

         @app.route('/user/<name>')
         def user(name):
             return f'Hello, {name}!'

         if __name__ == '__main__':
             app.run()
         ```
         
   c. Using templates and integrating with databases
   
      Flask provides a templating engine called Jinja2, which allows you to render dynamic HTML templates. Here are the steps to use templates and integrate with databases in Flask:
      
      1. Create templates in a templates directory:
      
         ```html
         <!-- templates/hello.html -->
         <h1>Hello, {{ name }}!</h1>
         ```
         
      2. Render templates in your view functions:
      
         ```python
         # app.py
         from flask import Flask, render_template

         app = Flask(__name__)

         @app.route('/')
         def hello():
             return render_template('hello.html', name='world')

         if __name__ == '__main__':
             app.run()
         ```
