A. -r option for recursively copying directories

The -r option in scp enables the recursive copying of directories. This means that not only individual files but entire directories and their subdirectories can be copied from the source to the destination. When using the -r option, scp will preserve the directory structure and transfer all files and subdirectories within the specified directory.

To illustrate the usage of the -r option, consider the following example:

```
scp -r /path/to/source/directory user@remote:/path/to/destination/directory
```

In this example, the entire source directory and its contents will be recursively copied to the specified destination directory on the remote machine.

B. -p option for preserving file permissions and timestamps

The -p option in scp preserves the file permissions and timestamps during the transfer process. This ensures that the copied files on the destination machine retain their original permissions and timestamps from the source machine. By default, scp does not preserve these attributes.

To use the -p option, simply include it in the scp command as shown below:

```
scp -p /path/to/source/file user@remote:/path/to/destination/
```

Using the -p option is particularly useful when transferring files that require specific permissions or when it is important to maintain the original timestamps of the files.

C. -v option for verbose output during file transfer

The -v option in scp enables verbose output during the file transfer process. When this option is used, scp provides detailed information about the progress of the transfer, including the files being copied, the transfer speed, and any errors or warnings encountered.

To enable verbose output, include the -v option in the scp command:

```
scp -v /path/to/source/file user@remote:/path/to/destination/
```
