I. Introduction to FastAPI
# I. Introduction to FastAPI

## A. Definition and overview

### 1. Definition of FastAPI

FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. It is designed to be easy to use and productive, while also being highly efficient and performant. FastAPI leverages the power of asynchronous programming to provide exceptional speed and scalability.

With FastAPI, you can create robust and scalable web applications that can handle a high volume of requests and provide real-time responses. It allows you to define API endpoints with simple Python functions, taking advantage of type annotations to automatically generate documentation and perform validation of request and response data.

Here is an example of a simple FastAPI application:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"Hello": "World"}
```

In this example, we import the `FastAPI` class from the `fastapi` module and create an instance of it called `app`. We then define an API endpoint using the `@app.get` decorator, specifying the URL path ("/") and the function `read_root` that handles the request. The function returns a JSON response with the message "Hello, World".

### 2. Overview of FastAPI's purpose and functionality

FastAPI aims to provide a modern and efficient framework for building high-performance web APIs with Python. It combines the ease of use and productivity of frameworks like Flask with the performance and scalability of asynchronous programming.

# B. Features and advantages

FastAPI has several features and advantages that make it a popular choice for building web APIs. Some of these features are:

## 1. High performance and scalability

FastAPI is built on top of Starlette, an asynchronous web framework, which allows it to deliver high performance. It leverages the power of asynchronous programming and provides excellent scalability. By utilizing asynchronous programming, FastAPI can handle thousands of requests concurrently without blocking the execution of other tasks.

```python
@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
async def read_item(item_id: int):
    # Fetch item from the database asynchronously
    item = await get_item_from_db(item_id)
    return item
```

## 2. Automatic API documentation

FastAPI comes with automatic API documentation support, which is a significant advantage for developers. It generates interactive documentation using the OpenAPI (formerly known as Swagger) specification. This feature allows developers to easily explore and test the available endpoints of their API.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
async def read_item(item_id: int):
    """
    Retrieve an item with the given item_id.
    """
    return {"item_id": item_id}
```

## 3. Fast development with code generation

FastAPI provides code generation capabilities, making it easier and faster to develop web APIs. It supports code generation for request and response models using Python type hints. By using code generation, developers can reduce the chances of errors and inconsistencies in their API implementation.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI()

class Item(BaseModel):
    name: str
    price: float

@app.post("/items/")
async def create_item(item: Item):
    """
    Create a new item with the given data.
    """
    # Process and store the item asynchronously
    await process_item(item)
    return {"message": "Item created successfully"}
```

## 4. Async support for efficient handling of requests

FastAPI fully supports asynchronous programming, allowing efficient handling of requests. Asynchronous programming enables the server to handle multiple requests simultaneously without blocking the execution of other tasks. This feature greatly improves the performance and responsiveness of the API.

```python
@app.get("/items/{item_id}/reviews")
async def get_item_reviews(item_id: int):
    """
    Retrieve the reviews for an item with the given item_id.
    """
    reviews = await get_reviews_from_db(item_id)
    return reviews
```

These features and advantages make FastAPI a powerful framework for building high-performance web APIs with ease and efficiency.

@app.on_event("shutdown")
async def shutdown():
    await database.disconnect()

@app.get("/users/{user_id}")
async def get_user(user_id: int):
    query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = :user_id"
    user = await database.fetch_one(query=query, values={"user_id": user_id})
    return user
```
