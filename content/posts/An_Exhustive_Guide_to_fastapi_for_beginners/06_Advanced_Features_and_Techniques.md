# VI. Advanced Features and Techniques

## A. File uploads and handling

File uploads are a common requirement in modern web applications. In this section, we will explore how to upload and handle files using FastAPI. We will cover various aspects such as accepting file uploads, configuring file upload size limits, handling file uploads, and validating file types and sizes.

### 1. Uploading files via API endpoints

#### a. Accepting file uploads with FastAPI

FastAPI makes it easy to accept file uploads from clients. To enable file uploads, you can define an API endpoint with a parameter decorated with the `File` type from the `fastapi` module. Here's an example:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, File, UploadFile

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/upload")
async def upload_file(file: UploadFile = File(...)):
    contents = await file.read()
    # Process the uploaded file here
    return {"filename": file.filename}
```

In the above example, the `upload_file` endpoint accepts a single file upload through the `file` parameter. The `UploadFile` type represents the uploaded file, and you can use its methods and attributes to access various properties of the uploaded file, such as the filename, content type, and file contents.

#### b. Configuring file upload size limits

By default, FastAPI imposes a maximum file upload size limit of 100 MB. However, you can configure this limit according to your application's requirements. To do so, you can specify the `max_length` parameter when defining the `File` parameter. Here's an example:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, File, UploadFile

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/upload")
async def upload_file(file: UploadFile = File(..., max_length=50_000_000)):
    contents = await file.read()
    # Process the uploaded file here
    return {"filename": file.filename}
```

In the above example, we have set the maximum file upload size limit to 50 MB (50_000_000 bytes). Adjust the `max_length` value as per your application's requirements.

### 2. Processing and storing uploaded files

#### a. Handling file uploads with FastAPI

Once you have accepted a file upload, you can process and store the uploaded file as needed. FastAPI provides various methods and attributes on the `UploadFile` type to handle file operations. For example, you can use the `read` method to read the contents of the uploaded file, the `filename` attribute to access the original filename, and the `content_type` attribute to retrieve the MIME type of the file.

#### b. Validating file types and sizes

It is often necessary to validate the types and sizes of uploaded files to ensure data integrity and security. FastAPI allows you to validate these aspects easily by leveraging Python's built-in file handling capabilities. For example, you can use the `file.content_type` attribute to check if the uploaded file is of an allowed MIME type. Similarly, you can compare the `file.content_length` attribute with predefined limits to enforce size constraints.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, File, UploadFile

app = FastAPI()

ALLOWED_MIME_TYPES = ["image/jpeg", "image/png"]
MAX_FILE_SIZE = 10_000_000  # 10 MB

@app.post("/upload")
async def upload_file(file: UploadFile = File(...)):
    if file.content_type not in ALLOWED_MIME_TYPES:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Invalid file type")

    if file.content_length > MAX_FILE_SIZE:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="File size exceeds the limit")

    contents = await file.read()
    # Process and store the uploaded file here
    return {"filename": file.filename}
```

In the above example, we validate the uploaded file against a list of allowed MIME types (`ALLOWED_MIME_TYPES`) and a maximum file size limit (`MAX_FILE_SIZE`). If the validation fails, we raise an HTTP exception with an appropriate status code and error message.

By leveraging FastAPI's file upload capabilities and validation techniques, you can confidently handle file uploads in your applications while ensuring security and data integrity.
# B. Database integration

## 1. Connecting to databases

### a. Configuring database connections in FastAPI

FastAPI provides a seamless way to configure database connections. By using the `databases` library, you can easily establish connections with different database engines such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, etc.

Here's an example of configuring a PostgreSQL database connection in FastAPI:

```python
import databases

database = databases.Database("postgresql://user:password@localhost/mydatabase")

# Optional: Create a function to connect to the database
async def connect_to_database():
    await database.connect()

# Optional: Create a function to disconnect from the database
async def close_database_connection():
    await database.disconnect()
```

### b. Handling different database engines (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL)

FastAPI supports multiple database engines, allowing you to work with different databases based on your project requirements. Besides PostgreSQL, you can also connect to other engines such as MySQL, SQLite, etc.

To connect to a MySQL database, you need to change the database URL accordingly:

```python
database = databases.Database("mysql://user:password@localhost/mydatabase")
```

Similarly, for SQLite:

```python
database = databases.Database("sqlite:///path/to/database.db")
```

## 2. Querying and manipulating data

### a. Writing database queries with FastAPI

FastAPI enables you to write efficient and secure database queries using Python's `sqlalchemy` library. You can leverage the power of SQLAlchemy's Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) to interact with your database tables.

Here's an example of querying data from a PostgreSQL database using FastAPI:

```python
from sqlalchemy import text

async def get_users():
    query = text("SELECT * FROM users")
    result = await database.fetch_all(query)
    return result
```

### b. Performing CRUD operations on database tables

FastAPI simplifies the process of performing Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on your database tables. With the help of SQLAlchemy ORM, you can easily manipulate and manage your data.

For instance, let's consider an example of creating a new user in a PostgreSQL database using FastAPI:

```python
from sqlalchemy import insert

async def create_user(username: str, email: str):
    query = insert(User).values(username=username, email=email)
    await database.execute(query)
    return {"message": "User created successfully"}
```

By utilizing FastAPI's database integration capabilities, you can seamlessly connect to various database engines and perform advanced data operations efficiently.

## C. Testing and debugging

Testing and debugging are crucial steps in the development process of any application, including FastAPI applications. In this section, we will explore how to effectively test and debug your FastAPI application to ensure its quality and reliability.

### 1. Writing unit tests for FastAPI applications

Unit testing is an essential practice for ensuring the correctness and stability of your FastAPI application. By writing comprehensive unit tests, you can verify the behavior of individual components and API endpoints.

#### a. Setting up the testing environment

Before writing unit tests for your FastAPI application, it is crucial to set up the testing environment properly. This involves installing the necessary testing frameworks and libraries, such as PyTest, and configuring the required dependencies.

Here is an example of how to set up the testing environment using PyTest:

```markdown
```python
# content of test_example.py

import pytest
from fastapi.testclient import TestClient
from app.main import app

@pytest.fixture(scope="module")
def test_client():
    with TestClient(app) as client:
        yield client

def test_hello_endpoint(test_client):
    response = test_client.get("/hello")
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json() == {"message": "Hello, World!"}
```
```

In this example, we define a test client fixture using PyTest's `@pytest.fixture` decorator. This fixture sets up a TestClient instance with our FastAPI application, which allows us to make requests to the API endpoints in our tests.

#### b. Writing test cases for API endpoints

Once the testing environment is set up, we can start writing test cases for our API endpoints. Test cases should cover different scenarios and edge cases to ensure the correct behavior of the endpoints.

Here is an example of a test case for an API endpoint:

```markdown
```python
def test_create_user(test_client):
    new_user = {"name": "John Doe", "email": "john.doe@example.com"}
    response = test_client.post("/users", json=new_user)
    assert response.status_code == 201
    assert response.json() == {"id": 1, "name": "John Doe", "email": "john.doe@example.com"}
```
```

In this example, we test the `/users` endpoint by sending a POST request with a JSON payload containing user details. We then assert the response status code and the expected JSON response.

### 2. Debugging and troubleshooting common issues

During the development process, you may encounter common issues that require debugging and troubleshooting. Understanding how to identify and resolve these issues is essential for maintaining the stability of your FastAPI application.

#### a. Identifying and resolving common errors

FastAPI applications can encounter various errors, such as HTTP 500 internal server errors, validation errors, or database-related errors. It is crucial to understand the error messages and logs to identify the root cause of these issues.

By inspecting the error messages and using FastAPI's exception handlers, you can pinpoint the source of the error and implement the necessary fixes.

#### b. Using debugging tools and techniques to diagnose issues

In addition to understanding the error messages, utilizing debugging tools and techniques can greatly assist in diagnosing and resolving issues in your FastAPI application. FastAPI integrates well with popular debugging tools, such as `pdb` or `ipdb`, allowing you to set breakpoints and step through your code to identify the problematic areas.

Furthermore, logging is an invaluable technique for tracing the execution flow and capturing relevant information during debugging. FastAPI provides built-in logging capabilities that you can leverage to gain insight into the application's behavior.

By combining error message analysis, exception handling, debugging tools, and logging techniques, you can effectively debug and troubleshoot common issues in your FastAPI application.

In conclusion, testing and debugging are vital aspects of developing a FastAPI application. Writing comprehensive unit tests and employing effective debugging techniques will contribute to the overall quality and reliability of your application.
