VIII. File Handling and Input/Output Operations
# VIII. File Handling and Input/Output Operations

## A. Reading and writing files in Go

In this section, we will explore how to read and write files in Go. File handling is an essential aspect of many applications, and Go provides a convenient and efficient way to perform these operations.

### 1. Opening and closing files

a. Using the os package to open files

To open a file in Go, we can use the `os` package's `Open` function. This function takes the file path as an argument and returns a pointer to the `File` type, which represents the opened file. Here's an example:

```go
file, err := os.Open("example.txt")
if err != nil {
    fmt.Println("Error opening file:", err)
    return
}
defer file.Close()
```

b. Specifying file access modes and permissions

When opening a file, we can specify the access mode and permissions using the `OpenFile` function from the `os` package. This allows us to control whether we want to read, write, or both on the file. Here's an example:

```go
file, err := os.OpenFile("example.txt", os.O_WRONLY|os.O_CREATE, 0644)
if err != nil {
    fmt.Println("Error opening file:", err)
    return
}
defer file.Close()
```

c. Closing files to release system resources

It is important to close files after we finish working with them to release system resources. We can use the `Close` method on the `File` type to close the file. It is a good practice to defer the closing of the file immediately after opening it. Here's an example:

```go
file, err := os.Open("example.txt")
if err != nil {
    fmt.Println("Error opening file:", err)
    return
}
defer file.Close()
// Perform read or write operations on the file
```

### 2. Reading data from files

a. Reading files line by line

To read a file line by line, we can use the `bufio` package's `Scanner` type in conjunction with the `os` package's `Open` function. Here's an example:

```go
file, err := os.Open("example.txt")
if err != nil {
    fmt.Println("Error opening file:", err)
    return
}
defer file.Close()

scanner := bufio.NewScanner(file)
for scanner.Scan() {
    line := scanner.Text()
    fmt.Println(line)
}
```

b. Reading files as a whole

If we want to read the entire contents of a file at once, we can use the `ioutil` package's `ReadFile` function. This function reads the file and returns the content as a byte slice. Here's an example:

```go
content, err := ioutil.ReadFile("example.txt")
if err != nil {
    fmt.Println("Error reading file:", err)
    return
}

fmt.Println(string(content))
```

c. Handling different file formats (e.g., CSV, JSON)

When working with files of different formats, such as CSV or JSON, Go provides specialized packages to handle them efficiently. For example, we can use the `encoding/csv` package to read and write CSV files, or the `encoding/json` package to handle JSON files.

### 3. Writing data to files

a. Writing data line by line

To write data line by line to a file, we can use the `bufio` package's `Writer` type in conjunction with the `os` package's `OpenFile` function. Here's an example:

```go
file, err := os.OpenFile("example.txt", os.O_WRONLY|os.O_CREATE, 0644)
if err != nil {
    fmt.Println("Error opening file:", err)
    return
}
defer file.Close()

writer := bufio.NewWriter(file)
writer.WriteString("Line 1\n")
writer.WriteString("Line 2\n")
writer.Flush()
```

b. Writing data as a whole

If we want to write data as a whole to a file, we can use the `ioutil` package's `WriteFile` function. This function takes the file path, content as a byte slice, and permissions as arguments. Here's an example:

```go
content := []byte("Hello, world!")

err := ioutil.WriteFile("example.txt", content, 0644)
if err != nil {
    fmt.Println("Error writing file:", err)
    return
}
```

c. Formatting data before writing (e.g., using strconv to convert numbers to strings)

Before writing data to a file, we might need to format it according to our requirements. For example, if we want to write numbers as strings, we can use the `strconv` package to convert them. Here's an example:

```go
file, err := os.OpenFile("example.txt", os.O_WRONLY|os.O_CREATE, 0644)
if err != nil {
    fmt.Println("Error opening file:", err)
    return
}
defer file.Close()

number := 42
stringNumber := strconv.Itoa(number)

file.WriteString(stringNumber)
```

In this example, we convert the number `42` to a string using the `strconv.Itoa` function before writing it to the file.

By understanding how to read and write files in Go, we can efficiently handle file-related operations in our applications.
# B. Working with directories and file operations

## 1. Creating and deleting directories

### a. Using the os package to create directories

In Go, you can use the `os` package to create directories. The `Mkdir` function allows you to create a new directory with the specified name. Here's an example:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	err := os.Mkdir("new_directory", 0755)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		return
	}

	fmt.Println("Directory created successfully.")
}
```

In the above example, we use the `Mkdir` function to create a directory called "new_directory" with permissions set to `0755`. If the directory creation is successful, the message "Directory created successfully." is printed. Otherwise, an error message is displayed.

### b. Removing directories and their contents

To delete a directory and its contents, you can use the `RemoveAll` function from the `os` package. Here's an example:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	err := os.RemoveAll("directory_to_delete")
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		return
	}

	fmt.Println("Directory deleted successfully.")
}
```

In the code snippet above, we use the `RemoveAll` function to delete a directory called "directory_to_delete". If the deletion is successful, the message "Directory deleted successfully." is printed. Any errors encountered during the deletion process will be displayed.

## 2. Listing directory contents

### a. Retrieving file and directory names in a directory

To retrieve the file and directory names in a specific directory, you can use the `ReadDir` function from the `os` package. Here's an example:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	files, err := os.ReadDir("directory_path")
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		return
	}

	fmt.Println("Directory contents:")
	for _, file := range files {
		fmt.Println(file.Name())
	}
}
```

In the code above, we use the `ReadDir` function to retrieve the file and directory names in the specified "directory_path". The names are then printed using a loop. Any errors encountered during the process will be displayed.

### b. Filtering files based on specific criteria (e.g., file extension, file size)

To filter files based on specific criteria, such as file extension or file size, you can use the `path/filepath` package in combination with the `WalkDir` function. Here's an example:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
	"path/filepath"
)

func main() {
	err := filepath.WalkDir("directory_path", func(path string, d os.DirEntry, err error) error {
		if err != nil {
			fmt.Println(err)
			return nil
		}

		if !d.IsDir() && filepath.Ext(path) == ".txt" && d.Size() > 1024 {
			fmt.Println(path)
		}

		return nil
	})

	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		return
	}
}
```

In the code snippet above, we use the `WalkDir` function to traverse the "directory_path" and apply filters to the files. In this example, we filter files with the ".txt" extension and a size greater than 1024 bytes. The filtered file paths are then printed. Any errors encountered during the process will be displayed.
# VIII. File Handling and Input/Output Operations

## C. Input/output operations and standard I/O

### 1. Input/output streams and file descriptors
   a. Understanding the concept of streams and file descriptors
   
   In Go, input and output operations are performed using streams. A stream is a sequence of data that can be read from or written to. In Go, streams are represented by file descriptors, which are numerical identifiers for open files. File descriptors allow us to perform various operations on files, such as reading from or writing to them.
   
   ```go
   // Example of opening a file and getting its file descriptor
   file, err := os.Open("example.txt")
   if err != nil {
       fmt.Println("Error opening file:", err)
       return
   }
   defer file.Close()
   
   fileDescriptor := file.Fd()
   fmt.Println("File descriptor:", fileDescriptor)
   ```
   
   b. Differentiating between standard input, output, and error streams
   
   In Go, there are three standard streams available for input/output operations: standard input (stdin), standard output (stdout), and standard error (stderr). These streams are predefined and can be accessed using the os package. The standard input stream (stdin) is used for reading input from the user, while the standard output stream (stdout) is used for writing output to the console. The standard error stream (stderr) is used for printing error messages or reporting errors to the user.
   
   ```go
   // Example of writing to the standard output stream
   fmt.Println("Hello, world!")
   
   // Example of printing to the standard error stream
   fmt.Fprintln(os.Stderr, "An error occurred")
   ```
   
   c. Redirecting input/output streams
   
   In Go, it is possible to redirect the standard input, output, and error streams to different sources. This can be useful in scenarios where we want to read input from a file instead of the keyboard, or redirect output to a file instead of the console. The os package provides functions for redirecting streams, such as os.Stdin, os.Stdout, and os.Stderr.
   
   ```go
   // Example of redirecting the standard input stream
   file, err := os.Open("input.txt")
   if err != nil {
       fmt.Println("Error opening file:", err)
       return
   }
   defer file.Close()
   
   os.Stdin = file
   
   // Example of redirecting the standard output stream
   file, err := os.Create("output.txt")
   if err != nil {
       fmt.Println("Error creating file:", err)
       return
   }
   defer file.Close()
   
   os.Stdout = file
   
   // Example of redirecting the standard error stream
   file, err := os.OpenFile("error.txt", os.O_WRONLY|os.O_CREATE|os.O_APPEND, 0644)
   if err != nil {
       fmt.Println("Error opening file:", err)
       return
   }
   defer file.Close()
   
   os.Stderr = file
   ```

### 2. Reading input from the user
   a. Using the bufio package to read input from the command line
   
   The bufio package in Go provides a convenient way to read input from the command line. It provides the Scanner type, which can be used to read input line by line or word by word.
   
   ```go
   scanner := bufio.NewScanner(os.Stdin)
   
   fmt.Print("Enter your name: ")
   scanner.Scan()
   name := scanner.Text()
   
   fmt.Println("Hello, " + name + "!")
   ```
   
   b. Validating and parsing user input
   
   When reading input from the user, it is important to validate and parse the input to ensure it meets certain requirements or constraints. Go provides various functions and packages for validating and parsing user input, such as the strconv package for converting strings to other data types and regular expressions for pattern matching.
   
   ```go
   scanner := bufio.NewScanner(os.Stdin)
   
   fmt.Print("Enter your age: ")
   scanner.Scan()
   ageStr := scanner.Text()
   
   age, err := strconv.Atoi(ageStr)
   if err != nil {
       fmt.Println("Invalid age:", err)
       return
   }
   
   if age < 0 || age > 150 {
       fmt.Println("Invalid age: age must be between 0 and 150")
       return
   }
   
   fmt.Println("Your age is:", age)
   ```

### 3. Writing output to the console
   a. Printing data to the console using fmt package
   
   The fmt package in Go provides functions for printing data to the console in a formatted way. The Println function can be used to print data followed by a newline character, while the Printf function can be used to print data with specific formatting options.
   
   ```go
   name := "John"
   age := 30
   
   fmt.Println("Name:", name)
   fmt.Printf("Age: %d\n", age)
   ```
   
   b. Formatting output for better readability
   
   When printing data to the console, it is often necessary to format the output to make it more readable. The fmt package provides various formatting options, such as specifying the width and precision of numbers, aligning text, and using padding.
   
   ```go
   balance := 1234.56789
   
   fmt.Printf("Balance: %.2f\n", balance)
   fmt.Printf("Balance: %10.2f\n", balance)
   fmt.Printf("Balance: %-10.2f\n", balance)
   ```
   
   c. Handling errors and reporting them to the user
   
   When performing input/output operations, it is important to handle errors properly and report them to the user in a clear and informative way. Go provides the error type, which can be used to represent and handle errors. Error messages can be printed to the standard error stream (stderr) using the fmt package or logged to a file or other logging mechanism.
   
   ```go
   _, err := os.Open("nonexistent.txt")
   if err != nil {
       fmt.Fprintln(os.Stderr, "Error opening file:", err)
       return
   }
   ```
