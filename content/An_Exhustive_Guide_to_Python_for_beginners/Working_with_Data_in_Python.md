III. Working with Data in Python
# A. Strings and string manipulation

## 1. Introduction to strings

Strings are a fundamental data type in Python that represent a sequence of characters. They are enclosed in either single quotes ('') or double quotes ("") and can contain letters, numbers, symbols, and whitespace.

Here's an example of creating a string:

```python
my_string = "Hello, World!"
```

## 2. String methods and functions

Python provides a variety of built-in methods and functions to manipulate strings. These methods allow you to perform operations such as converting the case of a string, finding substrings within a string, replacing characters, and more.

Here's an example of using the `upper()` and `lower()` methods to convert the case of a string:

```python
my_string = "Hello, World!"
print(my_string.upper())  # Output: HELLO, WORLD!
print(my_string.lower())  # Output: hello, world!
```

## 3. String concatenation and formatting

String concatenation is the process of combining two or more strings into a single string. Python provides multiple ways to concatenate strings, including using the `+` operator or the `join()` method.

Here's an example of using the `+` operator to concatenate strings:

```python
first_name = "John"
last_name = "Doe"
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name
print(full_name)  # Output: John Doe
```

String formatting allows you to insert values into a string in a structured way. Python provides different approaches for string formatting, including using the `%` operator or the `format()` method.

Here's an example of using the `%` operator for string formatting:

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 25
message = "My name is %s and I am %d years old." % (name, age)
print(message)  # Output: My name is Alice and I am 25 years old.
```

## 4. String slicing and indexing

String slicing and indexing allow you to access specific characters or subsequences within a string. In Python, strings are zero-indexed, meaning the first character has an index of 0.

Here's an example of using string slicing and indexing:

```python
my_string = "Hello, World!"
print(my_string[7])       # Output: W
print(my_string[0:5])     # Output: Hello
print(my_string[-6:-1])   # Output: World
```

## 5. Common string operations

Python provides several common string operations that can be useful in various scenarios. These operations include checking if a string starts or ends with a specific substring, counting occurrences of a substring, and more.

Here's an example of using some common string operations:

```python
my_string = "Hello, World!"
print(my_string.startswith("Hello"))  # Output: True
print(my_string.endswith("World!"))   # Output: True
print(my_string.count("l"))           # Output: 3
```

These are just a few examples of what you can do with strings in Python. Strings are versatile and widely used in various programming tasks, making them an essential topic to understand for beginners.
# B. Lists, tuples, and sets

## 1. Introduction to lists, tuples, and sets

In Python, lists, tuples, and sets are three different types of collections used to store multiple items. Each of these data structures has its own characteristics and use cases.

### Lists

A list is an ordered collection of items enclosed in square brackets ([]). Lists are mutable, meaning that their elements can be modified after creation. Lists allow duplicates and can contain items of different data types.

Here is an example of a list:

```markdown
my_list = [1, 2, 3, "four", 5.0]
```

### Tuples

A tuple is an ordered collection of items enclosed in parentheses (()). Tuples are immutable, which means their elements cannot be changed after creation. Tuples allow duplicates and can contain items of different data types.

Here is an example of a tuple:

```markdown
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, "four", 5.0)
```

### Sets

A set is an unordered collection of unique items enclosed in curly braces ({}). Sets are mutable and do not allow duplicates. Sets can only contain items of immutable data types, such as numbers, strings, and tuples.

Here is an example of a set:

```markdown
my_set = {1, 2, 3, "four", 5.0}
```

## 2. Creating and accessing elements in lists, tuples, and sets

### Creating Lists

Lists can be created by enclosing items in square brackets ([]). The items can be of any data type and can include duplicates.

```markdown
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

### Creating Tuples

Tuples can be created by enclosing items in parentheses (()). The items can be of any data type and can include duplicates.

```markdown
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
```

### Creating Sets

Sets can be created by enclosing items in curly braces ({}). The items must be of immutable data types and cannot include duplicates.

```markdown
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
```

### Accessing Elements

To access elements in a list, tuple, or set, we can use indexing. Indexing starts from 0 for the first element and goes up to n-1 for the nth element.

```markdown
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(my_list[0])  # Output: 1

my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
print(my_tuple[2])  # Output: 3

my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
print(3 in my_set)  # Output: True
```

## 3. Modifying lists, tuples, and sets

### Modifying Lists

Lists are mutable, so we can modify their elements by assigning new values to specific indexes.

```markdown
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
my_list[0] = 10
print(my_list)  # Output: [10, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

### Modifying Tuples

Tuples are immutable, so their elements cannot be changed. If we need to modify a tuple, we have to create a new tuple with the desired changes.

```markdown
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
new_tuple = my_tuple + (6,)
print(new_tuple)  # Output: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
```

### Modifying Sets

Sets are mutable, so we can modify them by adding or removing elements using appropriate methods.

```markdown
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
my_set.add(6)
print(my_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

my_set.remove(3)
print(my_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 4, 5, 6}
```

## 4. List comprehensions and generator expressions

List comprehensions and generator expressions provide concise ways to create lists, tuples, or sets based on existing iterables or conditions.

### List Comprehensions

List comprehensions allow us to create lists by iterating over an iterable and applying an expression or condition.

```markdown
squares = [x**2 for x in range(1, 6)]
print(squares)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

### Generator Expressions

Generator expressions are similar to list comprehensions but return an iterator instead of a list. They are more memory-efficient, especially when dealing with large datasets.

```markdown
squares = (x**2 for x in range(1, 6))
print(squares)  # Output: <generator object <genexpr> at 0x000001>
```

## 5. Common operations and methods for lists, tuples, and sets

### Common Operations

Lists, tuples, and sets support common operations such as concatenation, repetition, and membership testing.

```markdown
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_tuple = (4, 5, 6)
my_set = {7, 8, 9}

concatenated_list = my_list + list(my_tuple)
print(concatenated_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

repeated_set = my_set * 3
print(repeated_set)  # Output: {8, 9, 7, 8, 9, 7, 8, 9}
```

### Common Methods

Lists, tuples, and sets provide various methods to manipulate and perform operations on their elements.

```markdown
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

my_list.append(6)
print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

element_index = my_tuple.index(3)
print(element_index)  # Output: 2

my_set.discard(3)
print(my_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 4, 5}
```

In this section, we covered the basics of working with lists, tuples, and sets in Python. Understanding these data structures and their operations will allow you to effectively manipulate and process data in your Python programs.
# C. Dictionaries and Dictionaries Manipulation

Dictionaries are an important data structure in Python that allow you to store and manipulate data using key-value pairs. In this section, we will explore the basics of dictionaries, including creating and accessing elements, modifying dictionaries, using dictionary comprehensions, and common operations and methods for dictionaries.

## 1. Introduction to Dictionaries

A dictionary in Python is an unordered collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique. Dictionaries are defined using curly braces `{}` and colons `:` to separate keys and values. Here's an example of a dictionary that stores information about a person's name, age, and country:

```markdown
person = {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "age": 25,
    "country": "United States"
}
```

In this example, `"name"`, `"age"`, and `"country"` are the keys, and `"John Doe"`, `25`, and `"United States"` are the corresponding values.

## 2. Creating and Accessing Elements in Dictionaries

To add elements to a dictionary, you can simply assign a value to a new or existing key. Here's an example:

```markdown
person["occupation"] = "Software Engineer"
```

In this example, we add a new key `"occupation"` with the value `"Software Engineer"` to the `person` dictionary.

To access the value associated with a specific key, you can use square brackets `[]` and provide the key. For example:

```markdown
print(person["age"])
```

This will output `25`, which is the value associated with the key `"age"` in the `person` dictionary.

## 3. Modifying Dictionaries

Dictionaries are mutable, which means you can modify their elements. To modify the value associated with a key, you can simply assign a new value to that key. For example:

```markdown
person["age"] = 30
```

This will update the value associated with the key `"age"` to `30` in the `person` dictionary.

## 4. Dictionary Comprehensions

Similar to list comprehensions, dictionary comprehensions provide a concise way to create dictionaries. Here's an example that creates a dictionary of squares for numbers from 1 to 5:

```markdown
squares = {x: x**2 for x in range(1, 6)}
```

The resulting `squares` dictionary will contain the key-value pairs: `{1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25}`.

## 5. Common Operations and Methods for Dictionaries

Python provides several operations and methods to work with dictionaries. Some common operations include:

- Checking if a key exists in a dictionary using the `in` keyword.
- Getting the number of key-value pairs in a dictionary using the `len()` function.
- Removing a key-value pair from a dictionary using the `del` keyword.

Some common methods for dictionaries include:

- `keys()`: Returns a list of all keys in the dictionary.
- `values()`: Returns a list of all values in the dictionary.
- `items()`: Returns a list of all key-value pairs as tuples in the dictionary.

For example, you can use the `keys()` method to get a list of all keys in a dictionary:

```markdown
keys = person.keys()
```

This will return `["name", "age", "country", "occupation"]`.

These are just a few examples of the operations and methods available for dictionaries. Python provides a rich set of functionalities to work with dictionaries efficiently.

In this section, we covered the basics of dictionaries, including creating and accessing elements, modifying dictionaries, using dictionary comprehensions, and common operations and methods for dictionaries. Dictionaries are a powerful tool for working with data in Python, and understanding how to manipulate them will greatly enhance your programming capabilities.
# III. Working with Data in Python

## D. File handling and input/output operations

File handling is an essential aspect of programming, allowing us to read and write data to and from files. In this section, we will explore various file handling techniques and learn how to perform input/output operations in Python.

### 1. File handling basics

Before diving into reading and writing files, let's cover some fundamental concepts of file handling.

#### File modes

When opening a file, we can specify the mode in which we want to open it. Here are some common file modes:

- **"r"**: Read mode - opens an existing file for reading.
- **"w"**: Write mode - opens a file for writing. If the file doesn't exist, it creates a new file. If it does exist, it truncates the file to zero length.
- **"a"**: Append mode - opens a file for appending. If the file doesn't exist, it creates a new file.
- **"x"**: Exclusive creation mode - creates a new file, but fails if the file already exists.
- **"b"**: Binary mode - opens the file in binary mode.
- **"t"**: Text mode - opens the file in text mode (default).

To open a file, we use the `open()` function and specify the filename and mode as arguments. For example, to open a file named "data.txt" in read mode:

```python
file = open("data.txt", "r")
```

### 2. Reading and writing files

Python provides simple and efficient ways to read and write data to files.

#### Reading files

To read the contents of a file, we can use the `read()` method. This method reads the entire content of the file as a string.

```python
file = open("data.txt", "r")
content = file.read()
print(content)
file.close()
```

Alternatively, we can read the file line by line using the `readline()` method.

```python
file = open("data.txt", "r")
line = file.readline()
while line:
    print(line)
    line = file.readline()
file.close()
```

#### Writing files

To write data to a file, we use the `write()` method. This method writes a string to the file.

```python
file = open("output.txt", "w")
file.write("Hello, world!")
file.close()
```

### 3. Working with different file formats (e.g., CSV, JSON)

Python provides various libraries to handle different file formats like CSV and JSON. These libraries offer specialized functions to read and write data in those formats.

#### CSV files

To work with CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files, we can use the `csv` module. It provides methods to read and write CSV files.

```python
import csv

# Reading a CSV file
with open('data.csv', 'r') as file:
    reader = csv.reader(file)
    for row in reader:
        print(row)

# Writing to a CSV file
with open('output.csv', 'w') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow(['Name', 'Age'])
    writer.writerow(['John', 25])
    writer.writerow(['Alice', 30])
```

#### JSON files

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a popular format for storing and exchanging data. Python's `json` module provides functions to work with JSON files.

```python
import json

# Reading a JSON file
with open('data.json', 'r') as file:
    data = json.load(file)
    print(data)

# Writing to a JSON file
data = {'name': 'John', 'age': 25}
with open('output.json', 'w') as file:
    json.dump(data, file)
```

### 4. Error handling and exceptions in file handling

When working with files, it's crucial to handle potential errors and exceptions gracefully. Failure to do so may lead to unexpected program crashes or data loss.

#### Handling FileNotFound exception

If a file doesn't exist while trying to open it, Python raises a `FileNotFoundError`. To handle this exception, we can use a try-except block.

```python
try:
    file = open("data.txt", "r")
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
    file.close()
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("File not found!")
```

### 5. Common file handling operations

Python provides several common file handling operations to manipulate files efficiently.

- **Renaming a file**:

```python
import os

os.rename("old.txt", "new.txt")
```

- **Deleting a file**:

```python
import os

os.remove("data.txt")
```

- **Checking if a file exists**:

```python
import os

if os.path.exists("data.txt"):
    print("File exists!")
else:
    print("File does not exist!")
```

These operations allow us to manage files effectively within our Python programs.

In this section, we covered the basics of file handling, reading and writing files, working with different file formats, error handling, and common file handling operations. Proper understanding and utilization of these concepts will enable you to work with data stored in files effectively.
# E. Regular expressions

Regular expressions are a powerful tool for working with text data in Python. They allow you to search, match, and manipulate strings based on specific patterns. This section will provide an introduction to regular expressions, explain pattern matching with regular expressions, cover regular expression methods and functions, explore advanced regular expressions, and provide practical examples of using regular expressions in Python.

## 1. Introduction to regular expressions

Regular expressions, also known as regex, are sequences of characters that define a search pattern. They are widely used in various programming languages and text editors to perform pattern matching operations on strings. In Python, regular expressions are supported through the `re` module.

To use regular expressions in Python, you need to import the `re` module:

```python
import re
```

## 2. Pattern matching with regular expressions

Pattern matching is the primary use case for regular expressions. By defining a pattern, you can search for specific strings or patterns within a larger text. Regular expressions provide a concise and flexible way to describe patterns.

For example, suppose you want to find all occurrences of the word "Python" in a text. You can use the `re.search()` function to perform a pattern search:

```python
import re

text = "Python is a popular programming language. Python is versatile and easy to learn."

match = re.search(r"Python", text)
if match:
    print("Found a match!")
else:
    print("No match found.")
```

Output:
```
Found a match!
```

In this example, the pattern "Python" is searched within the `text` string using the `re.search()` function. If a match is found, it returns a match object; otherwise, it returns `None`.

## 3. Regular expression methods and functions

The `re` module provides various methods and functions to work with regular expressions. Some commonly used ones include:

- `re.search(pattern, string)`: Searches the string for a match to the pattern and returns a match object if found.
- `re.match(pattern, string)`: Checks if the pattern matches at the beginning of the string and returns a match object if found.
- `re.findall(pattern, string)`: Returns all non-overlapping matches of the pattern in the string as a list of strings.
- `re.sub(pattern, repl, string)`: Substitutes occurrences of the pattern in the string with the replacement string.

These are just a few examples; the `re` module provides many more methods and functions to handle regular expressions.

## 4. Advanced regular expressions

Regular expressions support various advanced features, such as character classes, quantifiers, grouping, and more. These features allow you to create complex patterns to match specific patterns in the text.

For instance, you can use character classes to match a range of characters. The pattern `[A-Za-z]` will match any uppercase or lowercase letter. You can also use quantifiers like `*`, `+`, or `?` to specify the number of occurrences.

```python
import re

text = "The cat sat on the mat."

match = re.search(r"[A-Za-z]+", text)
if match:
    print("Found a match:", match.group())
else:
    print("No match found.")
```

Output:
```
Found a match: The
```

## 5. Practical examples of using regular expressions in Python

Regular expressions are widely used in various practical scenarios. Some examples include validating email addresses, extracting data from text, and replacing specific patterns in strings.

Here's an example that demonstrates how to extract all email addresses from a given text:

```python
import re

text = "Contact us at info@example.com or support@example.com for assistance."

emails = re.findall(r"\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\b", text)
print("Email addresses found:", emails)
```

Output:
```
Email addresses found: ['info@example.com', 'support@example.com']
```

In this example, the regular expression pattern `\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\b` is used to match valid email addresses within the `text` string.

Regular expressions provide a powerful and flexible way to work with text data in Python. By mastering regular expressions, you can efficiently manipulate and extract information from strings, making it an essential skill for working with data in Python.

This concludes the section on regular expressions in Python.
